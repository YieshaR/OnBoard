 # Yiesha's Hack Card
 
<!-- I've made a blue business card in EasyEDA. It leads you to a link/website whenever you scan it. -->
 
<!-- $32.70 -->
 
<!-- My favourite colour is blue so I knew for sure that I wanted something blue. I just didn't know how to make it reflect my personality. After some scolling on a SVG website (and pinterest), I found 
little stars and fish icons and went with those. The design was semi based off of sme things I saw off of pinterest with fish. -->
